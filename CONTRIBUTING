---

Mapbase is a project which many Source modders draw from, so it has its own unique standards
for contributions which differ from other projects, but it is still an open-source repository
that is always open to contributions.

Whenever you contribute to the Mapbase repository, you must keep in mind that any contributions
made could be deployed to all mods utilizing Mapbase, which can include everything from high-profile
Steam mods to amateur HL2 maps.

All contributions must follow the following rules:

 * A contribution must be aligned with Mapbase's goals and priorities and should not be "subjective"
   or related to a specific mod or type of mod. For example, fixing an existing issue or adding a
   new tool for mappers to use is usually fine, but adding a new custom weapon with its own assets
   is usually not fit for Mapbase.
   
 * All content in a contribution must be either already legally open-source or done with the
   full permission of the contribution's original creator(s).
   
 * A code contribution should typically follow Mapbase's preprocessor conventions unless it's a massive
   feature which makes fundamental changes to several different parts of the code (e.g. reductor's VScript PR).
   When following these standards, all changes should be nested within "#ifdef MAPBASE", "#ifndef MAPBASE", etc.
   
If your contribution is accepted, you may be listed in Mapbase's credits:
	https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013/wiki/Mapbase-Credits#Contributors
	
You may also receive the "Contributor" or "Major Contributor" role on Mapbase's Discord server if you are
a member of it.
